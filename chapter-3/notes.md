## Structs

### Definition
- A struct is a user-defined data type that groups related data together.
- Structs are similar to classes in object-oriented programming.
- Structs are defined using the `struct` keyword.

### access-file function
- The `access_file` function reads a instance of the `File` struct and prints its contents.
- The function takes a mutable reference to a `File` instance as an argument.

### Structs vs Classes 
In Python or any other object-oriented programming language, you can define data and methods in a class. In Rust, we can define data in a `struct` and methods in an `impl` block.

```python

class File:
    def __init__(self, name: str, data: str):
        self.name = name
        self.data = data

    def read(self):
        return self.data

    def write(self, data: str):
        self.data = data
```

```rust
struct File {
    name: String,
    data: String,
}

impl File {
    fn read(&self) -> &str {
        &self.data
    }

    fn write(&mut self, data: &str) {
        self.data = data.to_string();
    }
}
```

## Error handling with Result
Rustâ€™s approach to error handling is to use a type that stands for both the standard case and the error case. This type is known as Result. Result has two states, Ok and Err. This two-headed type is versatile and is put to work all through the standard library.

### Definition
- The `Result` type is an enum that represents either success (Ok) or failure (Err).

## Enums
Enums are a way to create a type by enumerating its possible variants. Enums in Rust are similar to algebraic data types in functional programming languages.

### Definition
- An enum is a type that can have a fixed set of values.
- Enums are defined using the `enum` keyword.
- Each value in an enum is called a variant.
